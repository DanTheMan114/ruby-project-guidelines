## Goal / Requirements 

1. Contains at least three models with corresponding tables, including a join table.

2. Accesses a Sqlite3 database using ActiveRecord.

3. Has a CLI that allows users to interact with your database as defined by your user stories (minimum of four; one for each CRUD action).

4. Uses good OO design patterns. You should have separate models for your runner and CLI interface.


## Set up 
This link is the clone to the application. 

LINK -> 

The main directory, you've got a Gemfile that gives you access to activerecord, pry, rake, and sqlite3, faker, tty-prompt, tty-font

rest-client, colorize, and many more gems.
 
So, remember to bundle install, before running. 

In the bin directory, you've got a run.rb file that you can run from the command line with ## ruby bin/run.rb ##

In config, you've got your database set up with Active Record, as well as all of your models from the app/models folder made available to your database.

There is no spec directory. Your goal is to use the program and have fun shopping. 


## Info about the app

Okay to start this discription it was a blast making this application. Fire up the app with the ## ruby bin/run.rb ## then either make an account and get to shopping. Or take a step back and fix the profile settings. If you go along with shopping enjoy the smooth jass in the backgground. Then either add items to your cart and then check out or remove something. At the end of the program you will know when its over when you hear the mario coin sound.



## How to use 

1. To start the program user needs to type - ruby bin/run.rb - 

2. Next the user is able to make one of the three selections. 

3. Each taking them through all the current features of Shopping Cart.

4. Following the instructions that are showen, and have fun. 

4. After creating an account your able to get right to shopping or fix some profile settings if you like. 



## Some things we learned 

1. Google is the best 

2. If you can think it you can code it. 

3. We would go learn stuff and come back to each other and show how it works it was fun.

## Struggles 

1. Git would be public enemy number one for both of us. At one point we were so scared to submit code to git we just saved it to our computers and put it in a different file window to make sure it didnt get lost.

2. Lack of time we came up with a bunch of more ideas, the day before it was due.

3. Sometime during the end of the day on Monday the day before it was due we were stuck in a loop and could not find out where, but we ended up closing the whole Visual Code application and haveing to open it again and it worked. 


## Questions 

1. We wanted to be able to add add more music, we wanted to add api date, we wanted to add some 3d objects. 
As well have the user be able to add items to a cart by number and not just select one at a time. 

2. Blog coming soon..
